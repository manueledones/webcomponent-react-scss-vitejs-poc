// Pyxis set css variables on :root element (https://github.com/primait/pyxis/blob/0b2eb0ad4f7436921c34a1b16ed3b003d1e99616/packages/pyxis-scss/src/scss/foundations/_colors.scss#L46)
// but this doesn't work inside shadow DOM (:host should be used instead).
// So we're importing cssVariables in this global.scss file which is included with `import "./global.scss";`
// In this way vitejs put its content by default in a <style> element inside <head> element

// Ideally this should be removed from here and include it only once in the host application
// to prevent multiple web-components set/override the same style
